## Hello World

Hi, I am Ben King - I am currently working as Senior Software Engineer at NHS Blood and Transplant in Wiltshire (South-West), UK.

My main area of specialty is in C# .NET, with a focus on Azure microservices and infrastructure CICD including Azure DevOps, NuGet, and Terraform.

I am also passionate about high-availability technology, having worked with systems ranging from 1980s payments mainframe through to modern Cloud Services, including migrating complex legacy codebases to a supportable modern tech stack - if you do want to get in touch and hear about these experiences or anything similar, here are my social links:
